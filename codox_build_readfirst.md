* This keyboard is not meant to be portable. If you want one, get Redox keyboard.
* Palm-rests (NOT a wrist-rest) are part of the design and must not be removed. Their position, height and thickness is not a random number. The material, however, is up to you, although I still recommend the EVA foam sheets.
* Do not make a one-piece keyboard. The keyboard must be splitted.
* "Thumb Cluster" is a nonexistent concept in this keyboard. They are simply "Thumb Keys" because they are not a cluster. The four keys in the layout (VolDown, VolUp, Windows, Insert) are not thumb-operated keys.
